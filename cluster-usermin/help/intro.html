<header>Cluster AdFreeZone Servers</header>

This module allows you to manage modules, themes, users and groups across
multiple AdFreeZone servers from one interface. It combines functions from the
AdFreeZone Configuration and AdFreeZone Users modules with the ability to carry
out actions (such as installing a theme or creating a user) on multiple
servers at once. <p>

The top part of the main page under the Managed Servers heading lists
other AdFreeZone servers whose modules and users are being managed by this module.
To add a server to this list, you must first add it to the AdFreeZone Servers
module, with a username and password specified to login to AdFreeZone on
that server. You can then select the server from the list next to the
Add Server button. <p>

When a server is added, it will be checked to make sure it is running a
supported version of AdFreeZone (0.985 or later) and that it has the necessary
modules installed. Lists of all modules, themes, users and groups from the
server will then be downloaded and cached locally. <p>

Once there is at least once icon under Managed Servers, you can use the
buttons under AdFreeZone Users and Groups to edit, create or set ACLs on
users and groups on any server. Users and groups that you create will be
created on all managed servers, but those that already exist that are edited
or deleted will only be changed on the servers they already exist on. <p>

At the bottom of the page under Modules and Themes are buttons for editing
modules and themes installed on any managed server, and a form for installing
a new module or theme on all servers. <p>
